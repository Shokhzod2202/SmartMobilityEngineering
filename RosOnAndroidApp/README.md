# Final Project 
### My Part:
Running ROS on Android Device and connect it with master robot to control the robot remotely.
To accomplish this goal I used an open source RosJava Library which is developed with ROS. This library uses All the complicated ROS tools on an Android device and runs ROS. 
### My Project Included working with:
* rospy: A Python implementation of ROS that provides a set of ``client libraries`` for Python nodes.
* rviz: A 3D visualization tool for ROS that allows to ``visualize sensor data``, robot models, and other information in a 3D space.
* rqt: A framework for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for ROS.
* rosbag: A tool for recording and playing back ROS message data.
* Publisher.
* Subscriber.

  To See the Code Properly You Have to Open it inside Android Studio.
